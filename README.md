## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I learned how to use flexbox to arrange elements.

### Continued development

I'd like to do a deeper dive on flexbox to get a good understanding on how all of the flex items work together. There were a couple of times it took me some experimenting to figure out how to do what I wanted to do. I think if I learn more about flexbox, I may be able to figure things out a little faster.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Cheatsheet](https://yoksel.github.io/flex-cheatsheet/#section-alignment) - This helped me figure out what kind of flexbox stuff I needed to use while I was styling the site.
